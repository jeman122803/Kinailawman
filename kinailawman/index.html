                <h2>Astonished by the Dream</h2>
                <p>Astonished by the Dream to not face 
Internal destruction, I long to be
Exposed with your
Love undying.

Juvenile eyes that I have, saw the
Art that is you.
In the midst of the crowd, I only want to
Rest in your arms; 
Until I choose to 
Stay hidden beyond the stars.</p>

                <h2>If I Had Known</h2>
                <p>If I had known, I wouldn't have bled words and forced them to enter countless gated minds. If I had known, maybe I should’ve cut all my heart out and poured the blood into you. 
Maybe, the pain would’ve some kind of meaning,
Maybe, the songs and poems would've sought justice.</p>
                <p>He has this tradition of wanting to be the last to chat in an online conversation. I don't know where this may be coming from, but I know it comes from a special place in his heart.</p>

                <h2>A Man so Gentle</h2>
                <p>I mean, I could kiss him at that very moment,
But I just stared in awe of his presence. 
How could a man so gentle and understanding, exist?
I could kiss him at that very moment, but I chose to have some kind of delayed gratification.
Maybe it would not make sense now, but what if it would be of highest importance in the future?</p>

                <h2>Can He See into My Soul?</h2>
                <p>Well, he told me that I can smile using only my eyes. I was left confused. He clarified that he can tell whenever I’m genuinely happy if he looks into my eyes, and maybe his statement was a testimony to the saying, “the eyes are the windows to the soul.”</p>

            <section id="melody">
                <h2>Your Voice is a Melody</h2>
                <p>If only I could  translate how I feel about you.
It seems as though I have been hearing your voice all this time and I was so distracted that I did not even bother to stay silent and listen. 
I was aware of the humming inside my heart, a siren call. I heard it a few times, but I was naive to know that it was just the stars waiting to burst upon having contact with your skin. 
I have always felt like I was lonely and alone, it was fine if it was just alone but not the first, yet I felt both. 
You are pure energy made tangible, your light touches the wholeness of my soul that
I want to transcend my own created world and explore the universe that expanded in my mind, that is you.</p>

                <h2>2 Months After</h2>
                <p>Dalawang buwan na ang nakalipas noong unang malapatan ng aking paningin ang nakakaantig mong mga mga mata. 
Maibabalik ko na lamang ang mga alaala sa pamamagitan ng isang sirang plakang tumutugtog ng magandang himig sa aking isipan.
Ang himig na ito’y pinapalakas ng iyong matamis na boses habang sinasalita ang iba’t ibang katagang iyong ituturan.
Noong ‘di pa nga naabutan ang taas mong lipad ay ako’y nalalantang rosas sa ilalim ng araw, ngayo’y naapakan ko na ang langit mong bigay ay ako’y hinding hindi na mauuhaw.</p>

                <h2>You Taught Me How to Love</h2>
                <p>You taught me how to love,
a love that always move.
In your embrace, I find my core,
A love so deep, forevermore.

A sweet melody in your voice
When I listened, my heart is in rejoice
Your eyes talks, pulling me in
My body just initiates from within.</p>

                <h2>Toils and Troubles</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, we cannot just deny that we are also bound to get on the nerves of someone we dearly love. However, this kind of challenge is not meant to be viewed as something bad, rather a chance to grow. My love, di, today we fought over things we could not easily understand. I was a fool for making you feel frustrated, yet you insist on taking the load on yourself and kept telling me that it’s you who’s at fault. But please know you were never the one who’s in the wrong, we were just faced with a situation that’s a stranger to us, that we did not know how to welcome. But here we are in our home, embracing each other, and that, my love, is something worth fighting for. The mere fact that we are trying, it means that we are committed to success in this fight. In this battle I am willing to be your shield, to take on enemies that may come your way, and I would be your sword to slay them troubles away!</p>

                <h2>Love You to the Stars and Back</h2>
                <p>Nagtan–aw ta ganina og Love You to the Stars and Back, my love! Kahinumdum kayko sauna ba, first time nako nitan-aw ana nga salida grabe hilak nako, until now mao gyapon. The film is still the same, but when I watched it with you earlier, it had a new meaning—that every passing moment is precious, even at times that we are troubled, that we don’t have to try so hard to be happy, just the mere satisfaction of being able to breathe and see our loved ones happy is already enough, and that’s so good to know jud.</p>
